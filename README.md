<h1>Learniverse</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
There's a pressing demand for a unified learning platform: "Learniverse." Learniverse aims to simplify the studying process, enhance collaboration, and centralize educational resources. Offering such a comprehensive study tool not only benefits students but also has the potential to level the educational playing field worldwide. By making quality resources seamlessly accessible, Learniverse seeks to be invaluable to learners everywhere.
Once the users create an account, they can access all available features:<br>
-Managing schedules and deadlines by using a calendar, automated study plans, and reminders.<br>
-AI-generated study aid tools like quizzes, summaries, and flash cards; which are generated according to the users' uploaded materials (e.g., Lectures, Books,..).<br>
-Organizing functions like note-taking, to-do lists, GPA calculator, and focus techniques like Pomodoro.<br>
-A shared space that is suitable for teams to collaborate by sharing files and creating meeting rooms.<br>
-A public community that allows guest-users to view the questions and helpful answers created by registered users.<br>

We believe that Learniverse can help students achieve their wanted goals and grades by integrating the current features with the new AI generating capabilities in a single user-friendly platform.
